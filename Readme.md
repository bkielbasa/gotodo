# To-do app

This project is a playground for refacroting the project for practicing it :)

# Easy start

## Import the DB schema

Connect to your database (postgres) and execute every SQL query from `./migrations/` folder.

## Run it!

```go
POSTGRES_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost/mydb go run main.go
```

Where the `POSTGRES_URL` is your connection string to the database.
